=begin NAME

Template::Toolkit - A drop-in replacement for Perl 5's TT library

=end NAME

=begin SYNOPSIS

#    # Mix Perl5-style options ('PRE_CHOMP') with modern Perl 6 pairs
#    #
#    my $tt = Template.new( PRE_CHOMP => 1, :post-chomp(True) );

    # Use the old Perl5-style hashref.
    #
    $tt.process( 'slurp-me.tt', { session => { name => 'Joe Bloggs' } } );

    # Or the modern Perl6 inline arguments.
    #
    $tt.process( 'slurp-me.tt', :session( :name('Joe Bloggs') ) );

=end SYNOPSIS

=begin DESCRIPTION

Mimicking the Perl 5 Template Toolkit library as closely as possible, though not bug-for-bug, this aims to let you use your old Perl 5 .tt files in Perl 6 web applications without having to rewrite both your Perl 5 code B<and> your Perl 5 template files.

=end DESCRIPTION

=begin UPGRADING

Existing Template Toolkit files should for the most part render correctly. I'll make sure that the default TT5 filters exist, so code such as C<[% foo | html %]> runs without changes. Templates that use the C<PERL> and C<RAWPERL> should still parse, but the code within the C<PERL> and C<RAWPERL> blocks won't be run. If you're a brave soul, you can convert your code to use the C<PERL6> and C<RAWPERL6> directives.

TT5 constructor options should work, with a few exceptions:

    * VIEWS - TT5 and TT6 internals will be radically different.
              There may be a similar implementation, but it won't look the same.
    * CONSTANTS - Will B<work>, but internally there won't be a Perl 6
                  version of the TT compiler, at least in the first iteration.
    * CONSTANTS_NAMESPACE - See above
    * NAMESPACES - This won't be implemented because it ties me to the TT5
                   "namespace" API.
    * ERROR - This will be left to future versions
    * EVAL_PERL - Will exist, but be unused, as compiling raw Perl 5 code in a
                  Perl 6 template is pointless. There may be an EVAL_PERL6
                  option later on, though.
    * DEBUG - Will exist, but function differently because it too is tied
              to the Perl 5 API.
    * CACHE_SIZE - Will be accepted, but not implemented.
                   I might do something with Redis later, but not for the first
                   version.
    * STAT_TTL - See above
    * COMPILE_EXT - See above
    * COMPILE_DIR - See above
    * LOAD_TEMPLATES - Tied too closely to the Perl 5 API
    * LOAD_PLUGINS - See above
    * LOAD_FILTERS - See above
    * SERVICE - See above
    * CONTEXT - See above
    * STASH - See above
    * PARSER - See above
    * GRAMMAR - See above

I may be judging LOAD_* a bit too harshly. There will be internal classes for Templates, Filters and Plugins, but they probably won't act in the same way as their TT5 counterparts. So while you could theoretically write drop-in replacements (especially for Filters and Plugins) they woudn't have the same API.

Which is to say they may very well exist and be exposed to the user, but you'd probably have to rewrite your existing plugins to make them work with the new system; probably better to write from scratch.

Stash, Parser and Grammar objects are a bit different. It's probably easier in Perl 6 to override and rewrite these, but I also think that anyone that is insane enough to modify my grammar is already competent enough to do their own version of this module, so I might just let them override just for the lolcats.

=begin OPTIONS

=item ENCODING

The default is UTF-8, as is the case with all of Perl 6. 

As in Perl 5 Template Toolkit, you can set the output encoding using the C<ENCODING> option at creation time.

    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( ENCODING => 'Latin-1' );

The defa

=cut

=item OUTPUT

By default L<Template::Toolkit> prints to C<$*OUT>, just as in the Perl 5 version. You can also do roughly what you used to be able to do in the Perl 5 versions, with some slight syntactic changes. That is to say you can still print to alternate filehandles, print to files, copy the processed template to a string, add it to an array reference, or even just call a C<.print()> method. The rest of this block tells you how to do that in Perl 6.

To print to an open filehandle, just pass it as the C<OUTPUT> argument.

    my $fh = "foo".IO.open: :w;
    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( OUTPUT => $fh );

To print to a given filename, pass it as the C<OUTPUT> argument.

    my $filename = "foo.txt";
    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( OUTPUT => $filename );

To print to a string, pass a reference to the string as the C<OUTPUT> argument.

    my Str $output;
    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( OUTPUT => \( $output ) );

To add template contents to an array, pass a reference to the array as the C<OUTPUT> argument.

    my @output;
    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( OUTPUT => \@output );

You can also give C<OUTPUT> an object with a C<.print()> method, and it'll invoke C<.print()> on the instance you give it.

    class MyPrinter { method print( Str $str ) { print "[$str]" } }
    my $tt = Template::Toolkit.new( OUTPUT => MyPrinter.new );

=begin OPTION_NOTES

=item CONSTANTS, CONSTANTS_NAMESPACE

Left in place for backwards compatibility, but since this is mainly to improve Perl 5 precompilation, it's not as much of a win in Perl 6.

=cut

=end OPTION_NOTES

=begin METHODS

=item process( Str $filename, $stashref )

Given a filename, prints out the .tt file populated with the given stash referene. This uses the original Perl5-style hash reference, rather than the new lists of pairs that Perl 6 offers us.
